# chessAI
Check out the project in action here: https://anderswartz.github.io/chessAI/

With very little HTML, CSS, and Javascript experience, I have been working on creating a playable chess AI that can beat myself at chess. The goal of this project is to give me experience with hands-on problem solving, and to explore the different types of algorithms that are helpful in game-theory. I am currently avoiding any tutorials for chess AIs and seeing what I am capable of doing completely by myself. I am very good and chess and have always wanted to build an AI that can beat me. Although the project is still under development, it is currently able to host a local game between two players on the same computer. Don’t be surprised if the button for the black AI doesn’t work!

The current project is very disorganized and is currently undergoing lots of refactoring before development can continue.
